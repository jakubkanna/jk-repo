# Too Fast to Last
*Too Fast to Last* is a work made of an 3D printed object and printed on paper manifest in 2022. The work has been smashed in 2023 during [*STRESS TEST*](http://newscenario.net/stresstest/ "STRESS TEST") by newscenario. Altough the object is dead the idea stays alive.

# Files
The repo contains sliced 3D models. Sculpture is basing on Subaru Impreza rear wing and  has been prepared in blender. STL files are prepared for 3D print, designed to be aligned by 1,75mm pins and connected together by using addhesive.

Manifest has been added. Feel free to contribue.
